// AS A coding boot camp student
// I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
// SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


// ```
// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button
        //while loop
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

// WHEN I answer a question (for Loop, create an array of randomly assigned questions and then iterate)
    //How to make a question...
    //create objects with propoerties: question, answer w,x,y,z are booleons
    //on click check to see if it is true, 
    // else take away seconds from timer
// THEN I am presented with another question


// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock

// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
        //nest the game in a while loop and return when time is expired
// THEN the game is over

// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and my score
        //use the cache to create object with score and intials consecutive correct questions?
// ```
